    <p>
        <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/" target="_blank">Project Gutenberg</a> 
        is one of the earliest digital libraries and was founded in 1971 by Michael Hart. 
        Its goal is simple but powerful: to make books freely available online. 
        Unlike many modern digital libraries that require institutional access, 
        Project Gutenberg provides open access to public domain works for anyone with an internet connection.
        I chose this system because it represents an early model of what digital information sharing could look like.

    <h2 style="color:#1f618d;">System Introduction</h2>

    <h3>Context</h3>
    <p>
        Project Gutenberg began as a volunteer effort to digitize literary texts and make them widely accessible. 
        Over time, it has grown into a large-scale digital collection supported by distributed volunteers who 
        proofread and format texts. The system focuses on public domain materials, which allows it to legally 
        distribute full-text works without access restrictions.
    </p>

    <h3>Users</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>General readers looking for free books</li>
        <li>Students and educators</li>
        <li>Researchers in literature and the humanities</li>
        <li>Individuals interested in classic works</li>
        <li>Developers using open texts for digital projects</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Content</h3>
    <p>
        The collection contains more than 70,000 eBooks, primarily classic literature. 
        Each record typically includes basic bibliographic information such as:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Title</li>
        <li>Author</li>
        <li>Language</li>
        <li>Release date</li>
        <li>Available file formats (HTML, EPUB, Kindle, plain text)</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h2 style="color:#1f618d;">Discussion of the System</h2>

    <h3>Unique or Interesting Features</h3>
    <p>
        One feature that stands out to me is the system’s commitment to full-text access. 
        Instead of simply offering catalog records, users can immediately download entire books in multiple formats. 
        The volunteer-driven proofreading model is also interesting because it shows how distributed labor 
        can support large-scale information production.
    </p>

    <h3>Pros and Cons</h3>

    <table border="1" cellpadding="8">
        <tr>
            <th>Pros</th>
            <th>Cons</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Completely free and open access</td>
            <td>Limited to public domain works</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>No account required</td>
            <td>Interface feels outdated</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Multiple download formats</td>
            <td>Search tools are relatively basic</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h3>Suggestions for Improvement</h3>
    <p>
        Although Project Gutenberg succeeds in providing access, the interface could be modernized 
        to improve navigation and discoverability. Adding more advanced search filters or subject 
        categorization tools could enhance the user experience. While its simplicity is part of its charm, 
        improved metadata organization might better support academic research.
